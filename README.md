# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Description / Summary:
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions over two days, with only 492 labeled as frauds, making it highly imbalanced. The goal is to build predictive models to identify fraud in real time, helping banks minimize losses and improve customer trust.

Objectives:
Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.
Handle highly imbalanced datasets using advanced techniques.
Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Key Insights:
The dataset is highly imbalanced (fraud cases are only 0.172%).
PCA-transformed features prevent sensitive information exposure.
Machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost were applied with SMOTE balancing.
