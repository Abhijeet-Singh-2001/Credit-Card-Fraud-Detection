# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions over two days, with only 492 labeled as frauds, making it highly imbalanced. The goal is to build predictive models to identify fraud in real time, helping banks minimize losses and improve customer trust.
